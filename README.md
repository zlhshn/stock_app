## How to use?

## The structure followed in the project

- I created the project with the react library.
- First, planned the page structure using react router.
- Carried out global state management in authentication processes using **Redux** and **Redux-toolkit** .
- Validation operations in the form structure were performed using **Formik** and **Yup** libraries.
- Created page contents after testing api requests using **Postman**.
- The contents were displayed as cards on the company and brand pages, and new information was added and edited using the modal structure.
- All **CRUD** operations were done by sending a request to the API
- Transactions made using **Axios** were also controlled by creating a custom hook in the global state.
- User information was stored using **React-persist**
- Tailwind and Material UI libraries were used for styled
- **React-tremor** library was used for graphic drawings on the dashboard page
- It was written by trying to pay attention to **DRY** principles.
