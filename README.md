### STOCK MANAGEMENT APP

## Project Description

In this project, I aimed to create a frontend stock management project with global state management and working with Restapi.

## The structure followed in the project

- I created the project with the react library, which is a js framework.
- First, planned the page structure using react router.
- Carried out global state management in authentication processes using redux and redux-toolkit .
- Validation operations in the form structure were performed using formik and yup libraries.
- Created page contents after testing api requests using Postman.
- The contents were displayed as cards on the company and brand pages, and new information was added and edited using the modal structure.
- All CRUD operations were done by sending a request to the API
- Transactions made using Axios were also controlled by creating a custom hook in the global state.
- User information was stored using react-persist
- Tailwind and material UI libraries were used for styled
- React-tremor library was used for graphic drawings on the dashboard page
- It was written by trying to pay attention to DRY principles.
